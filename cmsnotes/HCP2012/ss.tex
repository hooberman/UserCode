\section{Search in the Same-sign Dilepton Final State}
\label{sec:ss}

A wide variety of new physics processes may produce events with two same-sign (SS) leptons, which provides a very clean
final state due to low SM background expectations. In particular, this final state is sensitive to top
squarks produced in the decays of gluinos (Fig.~\ref{fig:diagrams}X) and to the pair production of bottom squarks
followed by the decay $\tilde{b}\to t \chi^{\pm}$. 

We select events with two leptons (e or $\mu$) with \pt\ $>$ 20 GeV and dilepton invariant mass $m_{\ell\ell}>8$ GeV. 
We reject events with a third lepton with \pt\ $>$ 10 GeV that forms an opposite-sign
same-flavor pair with $76 < m_{\ell\ell} < 106$ GeV with either selected lepton, to suppress
the background from WZ and ZZ. We require the presence of at least two jets with \pt\ $>$ 40 GeV.

This analysis is an extension of a previous search in the same-sign dilepton final state~\cite{ref:ss_inclusive}.
In that analysis, the background is dominated by \ttljets\ where one lepton is from the W decay and the other
lepton is produced in the decay of one of the b-jets. In this analysis we require the presence of at least two
b-tagged jets. The requirement that both b-jets are identified and well separated from the selected leptons
reduces the \ttljets\ background by an order of magnitude. 

There are three sources of SM background. 
The first background source is referred to as ``fake leptons'' and includes leptons from heavy-flavor decay, misidentified hadrons, 
muons from meson decay in flight, or electrons from unidentified photon conversions. 
This background is estimated from a sample of events with at least one lepton that passes a loose selection but fails the full analysis
identification and isolation requirements, using the probability for a fake lepton satisfying the loose selection to also pass the analysis
selection, which is determined based on studies of fake leptons in jet events.
The second background, estimated from MC, consists of rare SM processes and is dominated by $t\bar{t}$W and $t\bar{t}$Z.
The systematic uncertainty on both the fake lepton and rare backgrounds is 50\%. 
A third, small background contributions is from ``charge flips'' and consists of events with opposite-sign leptons where one of the leptons
is an electron whose charge is misreconstructed. This background is based on the MC prediction, which is validated using a sample of Z$\to e^+e^-$ events.

Signal regions are defined by placing additional requirements on the jet multiplicity, b-tagged jet multiplicity, \met, and $H_T$, defined as the scalar 
sum of the transverse momenta of selected jets. The observed data yields in these signal regions is compared to the SM background expectations in 
Table~\ref{tab:ss}. Good agreement is observed between the data and the expected background in all signal regions.

The results are interpreted in the context of the model of gluino-mediated top squark production and bottom squark production indicated in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:diagrams}b and Fig.~\ref{fig:diagrams}d, respectively, in Fig.~\ref{fig:ss_interpretation}. 
For both of these models, the most sensitive signal region is SR6 (see Table~\ref{tab:ss}).
Results are presented in the plane
of squark mass vs. gluino mass, for a fixed choice of \lsp\ and \chip\ masses, and represent lower limits on the gluino mass of approximately 1 TeV in these scenarios.
Additional interpretations for other models and for different choices of \lsp\ and \chip\ masses are presented in Ref.~\cite{ref:ss}.
