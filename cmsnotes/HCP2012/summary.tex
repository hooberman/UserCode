\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

Supersymmetry may provide a natural solution to the hierarchy problem if it introduces top and bottom squarks with masses not more than several hundred GeV.
In this note we present the results of three searches for the direct pair production of top and bottom squarks. No evidence for event yields beyond
the SM expectations is observed. The results are used to place stringent constraints on the masses of top and bottom squarks, in the mass range relevant
for the natural solution to the hierarchy problem.
