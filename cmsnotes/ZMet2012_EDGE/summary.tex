\section{Summary of Results}

\begin{itemize}
\item We reproduce the yields in the Z mass region for the two signal regions of the OSSF edge analysis in the ee, 
$\mu\mu$ and e$\mu$ final states to within 3\% of the ETH results for all channels.
\item We have predicted the background in the Z mass regions of the two signal regions using the \MET\ templates technique:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the low \MET\ signal region we observe 288 events and predict 251 $\pm$ 33 events.
\item In the high \MET\ signal region we observe 167 events and predict 177 $\pm$ 25 events.
\end{itemize}
\item We have extrapolated the predicted Z background to the low mass region to estimate the $\gamma^*/Z$ background using the ``$R_{out/in}$'' technique:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the low \MET\ signal region we predict  5.4 $\pm$ 1.9 events.
\item In the high \MET\ signal region we predict  7.9 $\pm$ 2.7 events.
\end{itemize}
\item We have verified that the excess of same-flavor vs. opposite-flavor dilepton events persists when using single lepton triggers.
\end{itemize}
