\section{Introduction}
\label{ref:intro}

The Aachen and ETH groups have reported an excess of events with low mass, opposite-sign same-flavor (OSSF) lepton pairs,
as described in AN-2012/200 (Aachen) and AN-2012/231 (ETH). In Sec.~\ref{sec:sync} we define the signal regions used
in the analysis and demonstrate the level of synchronization with the ETH and Aachen authors.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:templates} of this note, we use the \MET\ templates 
technique~\cite{ref:Zpaper} to estimate the Z background in the Z mass region for the two signal regions used in this analysis. 
This prediction is extrapolated to low mass to estimate the $\gamma^*/Z$ contribution. In Sec.~\ref{sec:triggers} we cross-check 
the results of the nominal analysis based on dilepton triggers using single lepton triggers.
{\bf All results presented here are based on 9.2 fb$^{-1}$.}
