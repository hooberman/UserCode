\section{CMS Detector}

%The following is copied from published ttdilepton paper
The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting
solenoid, 13~m in length and 6~m in diameter, which provides
an axial magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the field volume are
several particle detection systems. 
Charged particle
trajectories are measured by silicon pixel and silicon strip trackers,
covering $0 \leq \phi \leq 2\pi$ in azimuth and $|\eta| < 2.5$ in pseudorapidity,
defined as $\eta = -\log [\tan \theta/2]$, where $\theta$ is the
polar angle of the trajectory of the particle with respect to
the counterclockwise proton beam direction. A crystal electromagnetic calorimeter
and a brass/scintillator hadronic calorimeter surround the
tracking volume, providing energy  measurements of electrons and
hadronic jets. Muons are identified and measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in
the steel return yoke outside the solenoid. The detector is nearly
hermetic, allowing energy balance measurements in the plane
transverse to the beam direction. A two-tier trigger system selects
the most interesting pp collision events for use in physics analysis.
A more detailed description of the CMS detector can be found
elsewhere~\cite{JINST}.



%The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid,
%of 6~m internal diameter, providing a field of 3.8~T. Within the field 
%volume are the silicon pixel and strip tracker, the lead-tungstate crystal electromagnetic 
%calorimeter (ECAL) and the brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL). 
%Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel return yoke. 
%Charged particle trajectories are measured by the silicon pixel and strip tracker, covering $0 < \phi < 2 \pi$ in azimuth and $|\eta| < 2.5$, where the pseudorapidity $\eta$ is defined as $\eta = -log(tan(\theta/2))$, with $\theta$ being the polar angle of the trajectory of the particle.
%The ECAL has an energy resolution of better than 0.5\,\% above 100\GeV. 
%The HCAL, when combined with the ECAL, measures jets with a resolution 
%$\Delta E/E \approx 100\,\%\sqrt{E\,[\GeV]} \oplus 5\,\%$. 
%The calorimeter cells are grouped in projective towers, of granularity 
%$\Delta \eta \times \Delta \phi = 0.087\times0.087$ at central rapidities 
%and $0.175\times0.175$ at forward rapidities.
%Muons(electrons) are measured in the pseudorapidity range of $|\eta|< 2.4$ ($2.5$) respectively.
%More details about the CMS detector can be found elsewhere~\cite{JINST}.
