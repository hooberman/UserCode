\section{Limit on new physics - Correlated Flavor}
\label{sec:limit}

As already discussed, we see one event 
in the signal region, defined as $H_T>$300 GeV and 
\met$>150$ GeV.

The background prediction from the SM Monte Carlo is 
1.5 $\pm$ 0.5 events, where the uncertainty comes from 
the jet energy scale (30\%, see Section~\ref{sec:systematics}),
the luminosity (10\%), and the lepton/trigger 
efficiency (10\%)\footnote{Other uncertainties associated with 
the modeling of $t\bar{t}$ in MadGraph have not been evaluated.}.
The opposite flavor based background prediction is $1.5 + 2.2 - 0.8$.

Again, we remind the reader of the number of expected
LM0 and LM1 events from Table~\ref{tab:expect}: $15.1 \pm 1.2$ 
events and $5.9 \pm 0.04$ respectively, where the uncertainties
are from energy scale (Section~\ref{sec:systematics}), luminosity,
and lepton efficiency.
