%\section{Definition of the signal region}
%\label{sec:sigregion}

%We define a signal region to look for possible BSM contributions
%
%The choice of signal region is driven by 
%three observations. 
%New physics signals should have high $\sqrt{\hat{s}}$.
%Astrophysical evidence for dark matter suggests that
%we concentrate on the region of high \MET.
%High cross section new physics signals are likely to be produced 
%strongly;  thus, we expect significant hadronic activity in conjunction with the two leptons.
%by adding the following two requirements to the preselection described above:

To look for possible BSM contributions, we define 2 signal regions that preserve about 
0.1\% of the dilepton $t\bar{t}$ events, by adding requirements of large \MET\ and \Ht:

\begin{itemize}
\item high \MET\ signal region: \MET $>$ 275~GeV, \Ht $>$ 300~GeV
\item high \Ht\ signal region:  \MET $>$ 200~GeV, \Ht $>$ 600~GeV
\end{itemize}

For the high \MET\ (high \Ht) signal region, the MC predicts 2.6 (2.5) SM events, 
dominated by dilepton $t\bar{t}$; the expected LM1 yield is 17 (14) and the
expected LM3 yield is 4.3 (4.3).
