%\section{Definition of the signal region}
%\label{sec:sigregion}

%We define a signal region to look for possible BSM contributions
%
%The choice of signal region is driven by 
%three observations. 
%New physics signals should have high $\sqrt{\hat{s}}$.
%Astrophysical evidence for dark matter suggests that
%we concentrate on the region of high \MET.
%High cross section new physics signals are likely to be produced 
%strongly;  thus, we expect significant hadronic activity in conjunction with the two leptons.
%by adding the following two requirements to the preselection described above:
