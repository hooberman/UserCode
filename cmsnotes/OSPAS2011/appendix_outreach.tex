\section{Additional Information for Model Testing}
\label{sec:outreach}
Other models of new physics in the dilepton final state can be confronted in an approximate way by simple 
generator-level studies that compare the expected number of events in 34\pbinv\ 
with the upper limits from Section~\ref{sec:limit}.
The key ingredients of such studies are the kinematic requirements described 
in this paper, the lepton efficiencies, and the detector responses for \HT, $y$, and \MET.
%
The muon identification efficiency is $\approx 95\%$;
the electron identification efficiency varies approximately linearly from $\approx$ 63\% at 
$\pt = 10\GeVc$ to 91\% for $\pt > 30\GeVc$.  
%
The lepton isolation efficiency depends on the lepton momentum, as well as on the jet activity in the 
event.
In $t\bar{t}$ events, it varies approximately linearly from $\approx 83\%$ (muons)
and $\approx 89\%$ (electrons) at $\pt=10\GeVc$ to $\approx 95\%$ for $\pt>60\GeVc$. 
In LM0 events, this efficiency is decreased by $\approx 5$--10\% over the whole momentum spectrum.
Electrons and muons from LM1 events have the same isolation efficiency as in $t\bar{t}$ events
at low \pt\ and $\approx 90$\% efficiency for $\pt>60\GeVc$.  
%
The average detector responses (the reconstructed quantity divided by the generated quantity) 
for \HT, $y$ and \MET\ are consistent with 1 within the 5\% jet energy scale uncertainty.
The experimental resolutions on these quantities are 10\%, 14\% and 16\%, respectively.
