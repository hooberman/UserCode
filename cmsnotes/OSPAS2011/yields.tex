%\section{Preselection yields}
%\label{sec:yields}

The data yields and corresponding MC predictions after this event preselection
are given in Table~\ref{tab:yields}. The MC yields are normalized to~\lumifinal\ using 
next-to-leading order (NLO) cross sections. At the current LHC luminosity, the mean
number of expected pile-up interactions is approximately 5. In the MC, pile-up interactions
are superimposed on the hard collision, and the MC is reweighted such that the distribution
of reconstructed primary vertices matches that in data. As expected, the MC predicts that the 
sample passing the preselection is dominated by dilepton $t\bar{t}$. The data yield is in 
reasonable agreement with the prediction. We also quote the yields for
the LM1 and LM3 benchmark scenarios.

\begin{table}[htb]

\caption{\label{tab:yields} Data yields and MC predictions after preselection, using the quoted NLO production cross sections $\sigma$.
The \ttll\ corrresponds  to dilepton $t\bar{t}$, including 
$t \to W \to \ell$; \tttau\ corresponds to dilepton $t\bar{t}$ in which at least 1 $W$ decays via 
$t \to W \to \tau \to \ell$; \ttfake\ includes all other $t\bar{t}$ decay modes. 
The samples of MC $t\bar{t}$, $W^{\pm}$ + jets, and single-top events were 
generated with \MADGRAPH. The Drell--Yan sample (which includes events with
invariant masses as low as 10\GeVcc) was generated using a mixture of \MADGRAPH\ and 
\PYTHIA  and contains decays to the $\tau^+\tau^-$ final state. All other samples were generated with \PYTHIA. 
The LM0 and LM1 benchmark scenarios are defined in the text; the quoted $\sigma$ values refer to the total production
cross section for SUSY particles in these scenarios. Uncertainties are statistical only.
