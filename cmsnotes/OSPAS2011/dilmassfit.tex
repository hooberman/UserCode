\section{Search for a Kinematic Edge}
\label{sec:fit}

Many models of new physics produce an excess of same flavor (SF) $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ lepton pairs
with respect to opposite flavor (OF) $e\mu$ pairs. For example, such an excess occurs in SUSY models
in which the opposite-sign leptons are produced via the decay $\chi_2^0 \to \chi_1^0 \ell^+\ell^-$.
The kinematics of this decay also lead to a characteristic triangle-shaped feature in the distribution
of dilepton mass, which would provide unambiguous evidence for new physics.
In contrast, for the dominant background \ttbar, the flavors of the 2 leptons are uncorrelated,
as is also the case for other SM background processes such as $W^+W-$ and DY$\to\tau^+\tau^-$.
Therefore, for these processes the rates of SF and OF lepton pairs are the same; 
furthermore, the kinematic properties of events containing SF and OF lepton pairs are the same. 
This allows us to determine the SM background in the SF final state using events in the OF
final state; this technique is referred to as OF subtraction. In Sec.~\ref{sec:datadriven}
we search for an excess of SF with respect to OF events accompanied by large \MET\ and \Ht. 
In this section, we perform a fit to search for a kinematic edge in the dilepton mass distribution 
in SF events, in which we extract the background shape from OF events.

In order to further suppress DY, we increase the \MET\ requirement to \MET $>$ 100 GeV. 
We search for the kinematic edge in 2 regions.  The first region is a control region defined
as 100 $<$ \Ht\ $<$ 300 GeV, which is dominated by the \ttbar\ background; we use 
this region to validate our fit methodology and verify that a signal yield consistent with 0 
is obtained. We then proceed to search for a kinematic edge in the signal region defined as 
\Ht\ $>$ 300 GeV. Since we do not observe a kinematic edge in this region, we perform a 
fit to the dilepton mass distribution assuming an example signal shape from the LM1 scenario.

For each region, we begin by extracting the \ttbar\ shape from the dilepton mass distribution 
in events containing OF lepton pairs, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dilmasscontrol} (left). 
The background is described by:

\begin{equation}
B(\mll) = \mll^a e^{-b \mll}.
\end{equation}

For a potential signal, we use an edge model for a two-body decay, which comprises a triangular shape convoluted with a gaussian,
according to:

\begin{equation}
T(\mll) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}\int_0^{M_{cut}} dy~y e^{\frac{(-(\mll-y)^2}{2\sigma^2}}. 
\end{equation}

The position of the kinematic edge $M_{cut}$ is fixed based on the generator level
information for the signal model which is tested; for example, for LM1 
$M_{cut} = 78$~GeV. Finally, the $Z$ contribution is modelled by a Breit-Wigner 
convoluted with a Gaussian. We perform an extended, unbinned maximum 
likelihood (ML) fit to the distribution of dilepton mass for events containting SF lepton pairs. 
The shape of the \ttbar\ background is fixed using the results of the fit to the OF lepton pairs,
and the yield is allowed to vary within the 
statistical plus systematic uncertainty. 

We perform the fit in the control region 100 $<$ \Ht\ $<$ 300 GeV, in
which the \ttbar\ background, $Z$ background, and LM1 signal yields are allowed to vary in the fit. 
The extracted signal yield is $n_S = 2.4 \pm 4.7$, consistent with the background only 
hypothesis, as displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:dilmasscontrol} (right). 
The extracted $Z$ yield is $n_Z = 4.4 \pm 4.2$, which is 
used to constrain the $Z$ yield in the signal region. 

Next, we perform the fit in the signal region \Ht\ $>$ 300 GeV. The \ttbar\ shape
is extracted from OF events, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dilmass} (left). We
constrain the $Z$ yield in this region using an extrapolation in \Ht\ from the 
control region 100 $<$ \Ht\ $<$ 300 GeV. The $Z$ yield in the control region is
multiplied by a scale factor derived from $Z$ events in data with no requirement
on \MET, which quantifies the fraction of $Z$ events with \Ht\ $>$ 100 GeV which 
satisfy \Ht\ $>$ 300 GeV. Using this procedure we derive an upper limit on the
$Z$ yield in the signal region of $n_Z < 0.3$, which we use to constrain the
$Z$ yield in the ML fit. The extracted signal yield is $n_S = 4.6 \pm 3.2$,
which is consistent with the background only hypothesis within 1.4$\sigma$,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dilmass} (right).
