\section{Acceptance and Efficiency Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:systematics}

The acceptance and efficiency, as well as the systematic uncertainties in these quantities, 
depend on the signal model.
For some of the individual uncertainties, it is reasonable to quote values 
based on SM control samples with kinematic properties similar to the SUSY benchmark models. 
For others that depend strongly on the kinematic properties of the event, the systematic
uncertainties must be quoted model by model.

The systematic uncertainty in the lepton acceptance consists
of two parts: the trigger efficiency uncertainty and the 
identification and isolation uncertainty. The trigger efficiency 
for two leptons of $\pt>10\GeVc$, with one lepton of 
$\pt>20\GeVc$ is measured to be approximately 100\%, 90\% and 95\%
for events with $ee$, $\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$ leptons using samples of $Z \to \ell\ell$, 
with an uncertainty of 2\%. We verify that the MC reproduces the lepton identification and isolation efficiencies in data using
samples of $Z \to \ell\ell$; the data and MC efficiencies are found to be consistent within 2\%.

Another significant source of systematic uncertainty is 
associated with the jet and $\MET$ energy scale.  The impact
of this uncertainty is final-state dependent.  Final
states characterized by very large hadronic activity and \MET\ are 
less sensitive than final states where the \MET\ and \HT\ 
are typically close to the minimum requirements applied to these quantities.  To be more quantitative,
we have used the method of Ref.~\cite{ref:top} to evaluate
the systematic uncertainties in the acceptance for $t\bar{t}$ 
and for the two benchmark SUSY points using a 5\% uncertainty in the hadronic 
energy scale~\cite{ref:jes}.
The uncertainty on the LM1 signal efficiency in the region \Ht\ $>$ 300 GeV,
\MET\ $>$ 100 GeV used to search for the kinematic edge is 3\%.
For the high \MET\ signal region for $t\bar{t}$ the uncertainty is 35\%; for LM1 and LM3 the 
uncertainties are 14\% and 18\%, respectively.
For the high \Ht\ signal region for $t\bar{t}$ the uncertainty is 30\%; for LM1 and LM3 the 
uncertainties are 20\% and 21\%, respectively.

The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 4\%~\cite{ref:lumi}.
