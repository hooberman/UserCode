%\section{Trigger efficiency}
%\label{sec:trgEff}

We rely on a
mixture of single- and double-lepton triggers.  The trigger
efficiency is very high (typically in excess of 99\%) since
each of the two leptons can fire a single-lepton trigger.
%We apply to MC events a simplified model of the trigger efficiency 
%as a function of dilepton species, rapidity and $p_T$.
