A search  is presented for physics  beyond the standard  model (SM) in
final states  with opposite-sign isolated lepton  pairs accompanied by
hadronic jets and missing  transverse energy.  The search is performed
using LHC  data recorded  with the CMS  detector, corresponding  to an
integrated luminosity of 34~pb$^{-1}$.  No evidence for an event yield
beyond  SM  expectations is  found.   An  upper  limit on  the  non-SM
contribution to the  signal region is deduced from  the results.  This
limit  is  interpreted  in  the  context of  the  constrained  minimal
supersymmetric  model.  Additional  information is  provided  to allow
testing the exclusion of specific models of physics beyond the SM.
