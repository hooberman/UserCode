%\subsection{Non $t\bar{t}$ Backgrounds}
%\label{sec:othBG}

Backgrounds in which one or both leptons do not originate from electroweak decays (non-$W/Z$ leptons) 
are assessed using the method of Ref.~\cite{ref:top}.
A non-$W/Z$ lepton is a lepton candidate originating from within a jet,
such as a lepton from semileptonic $b$ or $c$ decays, a muon decay-in-flight, a pion misidentified 
as an electron, or an unidentified photon conversion.
Estimates of the contributions to the signal region from pure
multijet QCD, with two non-$W/Z$ leptons, and in $W+\mathrm{jets}$,
with one non-$W/Z$ lepton in addition to the lepton from the decay of the $W$, are
derived separately. We find $0.00^{+0.04}_{-0.00}$ and $0.0^{+0.4}_{-0.0}$ for the multijet
QCD and $W$+jets contributions respectively,
and thus consider these backgrounds to be negligible.

Backgrounds from DY and from processes with two vector bosons and single top 
are negligible compared to dilepton $t\bar{t}$.
