\section{Limits on New Physics}
\label{sec:limit}

We set an upper limit on the signal yield extracted by the fit to the dilepton mass
distribution, assuming the LM1 shape. The 95\% confidence level (CL) upper limit (UL)
is extracted using a profile likelihood technique, giving an UL of 14.3 events, including
uncertainties in the background yield and shape, resolution model and $Z$ yield.
In the limit setting we also include the uncertainties from trigger efficiency,
lepton selection efficiency, hadronic energy scale and integrated luminosity on the signal efficiency.
The expected LM1 yield is 23 $\pm$ 2 events. 

We set upper limits on the non-SM contributions to the high \MET\ and high \Ht\ signal regions. 
For both regions, we find reasonable agreement between the observed yields and the predictions from MC and from the ABCD' and \ptll\
data-driven methods. We choose here to extract the upper limits using the MC prediction for the
background estimate. The 95\% CL upper limit is extracted using a Bayesian technique~\cite{ref:cl95cms}, 
with a log-normal model of nuissance parameter integration assuming 0 signal efficiency uncertainty. 
The results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:results}. 

The results of the opposite-flavor subtraction are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:ofresults}.
We set a Bayesian 95\% CL upper limit on the quantity $\Delta$ and compare this to the predicted
values in the LM1 and LM3 scenarios.

\caption{\label{tab:results} 
Summary of the observed and predicted yields in the 2 signal regions. The uncertainty in the MC prediction is statistical only. 
The systematic uncertainties on the ABCD', \ptll, and OF subtraction predictions are discussed in the text. The non-SM yield UL is a 
Bayesian 95\% confidence level upper limit. The LM1 and LM3 yields include uncertainties from MC statistics, trigger efficiency,
lepton selection efficiency, hadronic energy scale and integrated luminosity.
