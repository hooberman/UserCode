\section{Limits on New Physics}
\label{sec:limit}

We set an upper limit on the signal yield extracted by the fit to the dilepton mass
distribution, assuming the LM1 shape. The 95\% confidence level (CL) upper limit (UL)
is extracted using a profile likelihood technique, giving an UL of 18 events, including
uncertainties in the resolution model and $Z$ yield.
The expected LM1 yield is 23 $\pm$ X events including the uncertainties from trigger efficiency,
lepton selection efficiency, hadronic energy scale and integrated luminosity; hence LM1 is excluded by these results.

We set upper limits on the non-SM contributions to the high \MET\ and high \Ht\ signal regions. 
For both regions, we find reasonable agreement between the observed yields and the predictions from MC and from the 2
data-driven methods. We choose here to extract the upper limits using the MC prediction for the
background estimate. The 95\% CL upper limit is extracted using a Bayesian technique~\cite{ref:cl95cms}, 
with a log-normal model of nuissance parameter integration assuming 0 signal . The results are summarized in 
Table~\ref{tab:results}. Based on these results, we exclude LM1 and LM3.

\caption{\label{tab:results} 
Summary of the observed and predicted yields in the 2 signal regions. The error in the MC prediction is statistical only. 
The systematic uncertainties on the ABCD', \ptll, and OF subtraction predictions are discussed in the text. The non-SM yield UL is a 
Bayesian 95\% confidence level upper limit. The LM1 and LM3 yields include uncertainties from trigger efficiency,
lepton selection efficiency, hadronic energy scale and integrated luminosity.
