\section{Results}

The data is displayed in the plane of \MET\ vs. \Ht\ in Fig.~\ref{fig:met_ht}.
We find 4 (3) events in the high \MET\ (high \Ht) signal regions, consistent
with the MC expectations.

for data. The high \MET\ (high \Ht) signal region is indicated with the
blue dotted (red striped) region.}

Next, we apply the ABCD' method to predict the yields in the high \met\ and high \Ht\
signal regions. The $y$ vs. \Ht\ distributions for data are displayed in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:abcdprimedata}. The signal regions are indicated, as well as the control 
regions used to measure the $f(y)$ and $g(H_T)$ distributions. For the high \met\
signal region, we find a predicted yield of 1.2 $\pm$ 0.4 (stat) $\pm$ 0.5 (syst), 
in reasonable agreement with the MC prediction. For the high \Ht\ signal region, we 
do not find any events in the control region used to extract $g(H_T)$ with \Ht\ $>$ 600 GeV,
and the ABCD' background estimate is therefore 0. To assess the statistical uncertainty
in this prediction, we add a single event ``by hand'' to the $g(H_T)$ distributiion
at $H_T = 600$ GeV, leading to a predicted yield of 0.0 $\pm$ 0.6 (stat) $\pm$ 0.3 (syst).

Next, we use the \ptll\ template method to predict the background in the 2 signal regions.
For each signal region D, we count the number of events falling in the region D', which is 
defined using the same requirements as D but switching the \MET\ requirement to a \ptll\
requirement. We subtract off the expected DY contribution using the data-driven $R_{out/in}$
technique, We then scale this yield by 2 corrections factors: $K$, the \met\ acceptance 
correction factor, and $K_C$, the correction factor determined in Sec.~\ref{sec:datadriven}.
Our final prediction $N_P$ is given by:

\begin{center}
$ N_P = (N(D')-N(DY)) \times K \times K_C$.
\end{center}

The predicted and observed \MET\ distributions in the 2 signal regions are displayed
in Fig.~\ref{fig:victory}. For the high \MET\ (high \Ht) signal regions we predict
a background yield of 5.4 $\pm$ 3.8 (stat) $\pm$ 1.7 (syst) 
(1.7 $\pm$ 1.7 (stat) $\pm$ 0.4 (syst)) events, consistent with the observed yields
and with the predictions of the ABCD' method. 

As a validation of the $\pt(\ell\ell)$ method in a region which is dominated by
background, we also apply the $\pt(\ell\ell)$ method in a control region by restricting
\HT\ to be in the range 125--300~\GeV. Here we predict 6.5 $\pm$ 4.4 events with
\MET\ $>$ 200 GeV, and observe 6 events in this region.

Our third background estimate is based on the OF subtraction technique. We observe
2 $ee$ + 1 $e\mu$ (1 $ee$ + 1 $e\mu$) events in the high \MET\ (high \Ht) signal
regions outside of the $Z$ mass region 76--106~GeV. This gives 
$\Delta = $ 1.3 $\pm$ 1.9 (stat) $\pm$ 0.1 (syst) 
(0.1 $\pm$ 1.5 (stat) $\pm$ 0.0 (syst)) for the high \MET\ (high \Ht) signal regions,
respectively.

A summary of our results is presented in Table~\ref{tab:results}. For both signal regions,
the observed yield is consistent with the predictions from MC and from the background estimates
based on data. We conclude that no evidence for non-SM contributions to the signal regions
is observed.
