\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}


We have presented a search for BSM physics in the opposite-sign dilepton final state using 
a data sample of proton-proton collisions at 7~TeV centre-of-mass energy corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of \lumi, recorded by the CMS detector in 2011.
The search focused on dilepton events with large missing transverse energy and significant hadronic activity,
motivated by many models of BSM physics, such as supersymmetric models.
Good agreement with standard model predictions was found, both in terms of event yields and shapes of 
various relevant kinematic distributions. In the absence of evidence for BSM physics, 
we have set upper limits on the non-SM contributions to yields in the signal regions.
