\section{Derivation of Upper Limits}
\label{sec:limits}

We proceed to set upper limits on the non-SM contributions to the 3 signal regions. For all 3 regions,
we find reasonable agreement between the observed yields and the predictions from MC and from the 2
data-driven methods. We choose here to extract the upper limits using the MC prediction for the
background estimate. The 95\% CL upper limit is extracted using cl95cms, using a log-normal model of
nuissance parameter integration. The results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:limit}. Based on these
results, we exclude LM1 but not LM3.

Summary of 95\% CL upper limits on the non-SM yield.  The LM1 and LM3
yields are shown, with uncertainties from the hadronic energy scale, lepton selection and trigger efficiencies,
and integrated luminosity.
