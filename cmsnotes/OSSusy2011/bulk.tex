\section{Properties of data passing the preselection}
\label{sec:bulk}
A number of kinematical distributions for events passing 
the preselection in data are compared with MC in 
Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix}.  We find that
the MC does a good job of reproducing the properties of 
the bulk of $t\bar{t} \to $ dilepton events.  Therefore
we turn our attention to the tails of the $t\bar{t}$ 
events.
