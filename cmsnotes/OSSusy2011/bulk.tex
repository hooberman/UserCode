\section{Properties of data passing the preselection}
\label{sec:bulk}
A number of kinematical distributions for events passing 
the preselection in data are compared with MC in 
Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_datamc}. Although we observe a
slight overall excess of data, in general we find that
the MC does a good job of reproducing the shapes of the
kinematical distributions. We keep in mind that the CMS 
luminosity estimate is expected to increase by a few percent. 
Given good observed agreement between data and expectation, 
we turn our attention to events in the tails of the $t\bar{t}$ 
distributions.
