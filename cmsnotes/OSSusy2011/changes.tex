\section{Changes since Last Version of AN}
\label{sec:changes}



\begin{itemize}
\item Changes to v5
\begin{itemize}
\item Added LM0 and LM1 yields to Table~\ref{tab:datayield}.
\item PDF uncertainties included in MSUGRA scan.
\item Better smoothing of curves in MSUGRA scan.
\end{itemize}
\item Changes to v4
\begin{itemize}
\item Better and more complete MSUGRA scan...but still missing
the PDF uncertainties.  Added LM1 to the plots in Appendix C.
\end{itemize}
\item Changes to v3
\begin{itemize}
\item Updated results using 38X MC.
\item Updated results using official json PVT v3.
\item Using NLO for the LM points
\item Finalized and expanded discussion of $P_T(\ell \ell)$ systematics.
\item Added a preliminary msugra scan
\end{itemize}

\item Changes to v2
\begin{itemize}
\item Updated Fig.~\ref{fig:uncor}, the demonstration that the ABCD variables are uncorrelated. 
\item Included systematics study of ABCD method (see Sec.~\ref{sec:abcd}), and assess corresponding scale factor
and uncertainty to prediction from ABCD method.
\item Included results of fake lepton background estimate (see Sec.~\ref{sec:bgfake}).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
