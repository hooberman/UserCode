\section{Fakeable Object Definitions}
\label{sec:appendix_fo}

We estimate the contributions from leptons not originating from $W/Z$ decay (fake leptons)
using the data-driven fake rate method~\cite{ref:top}. 
We define the following `fakeable object'
selections, by taking the electron and muon requirements listed in Sec.~\ref{sec:eventSel}
and loosening the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item{electrons}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item $d_0 < 0.2$~cm
   \item $Iso \equiv E_T^{\rm iso}/p_T < $~0.4, $E_T^{\rm iso}$ is defined as the sum of 
transverse energy/momentum deposits in ecal, hcal, and tracker, in a cone of 0.3
A 1 GeV pedestal is subtracted from the ecal energy  deposition in the EB, however 
the ecal energy is never allowed to go negative.
   \end{itemize}
\item{muons}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item $d_0 < 0.2$~cm
   \item $\chi^2$/ndof of global fit $<$ 50
   \item $Iso \equiv E_T^{\rm iso}/p_T < $~0.4, $E_T^{\rm iso}$ is defined as the sum of 
transverse energy/momentum deposits in ecal, hcal, and tracker, in a cone of 0.3
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
