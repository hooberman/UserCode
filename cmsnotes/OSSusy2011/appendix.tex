\section{Comparison of data and MC distributions}
\label{sec:appendix}
Here we compare data and MC distributions for data passing the 
preselection requirements.  In some cases, {\em e.g.} the 
\met distribution, we show the ``$N-1$ plot'', {\em i.e.}, the 
plot for the variable with all other kinematical cuts
applied except the cut on the variable itself.  The
cut value is then indicated by a vertical red dashed line.

The meaning of most of the variables plotted in 
the following figures should be obvious.  There
are some exceptions that we exlain below

\begin{itemize}

\item $MT2$ in Figure C29 is a kinematical quantity 
built from the two leptons and the \met.  For events with
two $W \to \ell$ decays it should have a sharp kinematical cutoff
at $W$ mass.  For more details, see Reference~\cite{ref:MT2}.

\item $MT2J$ in Figure C30 is very muck like $MT2$ but it is built 
out of the leptons the \met and the two jets.  For $t\bar{t}$
events it has a kinematical cutoff at $M_{\rm top}$, with tails
due to the fact that occasionally one of the $b$-jets is not
found and is replaced by a gluon jet from ISR or FSR.
For more details, see Reference~\cite{ref:MT2J}.

\item The reconstructed top mass in Figure C6 is from the 
kinematical mass reconstruction of the top dilepton group.
In this case we are using the $D0$ matrix-element technique.
See Reference~\cite{ref:brown} for more details.

\end{itemize}
