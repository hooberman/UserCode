For the high \pt dilepton triggers, the efficiencies have been measured to be approximately
100\% (DoubleEle), 90\% (DoubleMu), and 95\% (Mu-Ele)~\cite{ref:HWW}. 
In the following, unless otherwise specified we weight the $ee$, $\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$ MC events 
by these efficiencies. We do not apply any efficiency correction for the hadronic 
part of the dilepton-\Ht\ triggers. We have verified that the efficiencies for these triggers
with respect to an offline selection of \Ht\ $>$ 200 GeV is high ($\sim$90--95\%), 
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:httrig}.
