\section{Trigger efficiency}
\label{sec:trgEff}

The trigger efficiencies for the high \pt\ dilepton triggers have been measured to be approximately
100\% (DoubleEle), 90\% (DoubleMu), and 95\% (Mu-Ele). 
{\bf need to add either a reference (HWW note?) or put some material to back this up.}
In the following, unless otherwise specified we weight the $ee$, $\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$ MC events 
by these efficiencies.
