\section{Trigger efficiency}
\label{sec:trgEff}

The DoubleElectron triggers have an efficiency which is close to 100\%. However, the efficiency for a single
leg to pass the muon trigger is approximately 95\% ({\color{red} \bf NEED A REF OR SOME PLOTS IN BACKUP FOR THIS}),
causing the DoubleMu (El-Mu) triggers to have an efficiency of approximately 90\% (95\%). Unless otherwise
specified, these trigger efficiencies are applied to the MC. 
{\color{red} \bf IS THIS SUFFICIENT? DO WE WANT A MORE DETAILED TRIG EFFICIENCY MODEL, OR MORE ACCURATE TRIG EFFICIENCIES?}


{\color{red} \bf WILL ADD HT TURN ON CURVES HERE.}
