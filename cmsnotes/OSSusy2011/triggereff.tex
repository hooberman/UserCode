\section{Trigger efficiency}
\label{sec:trgEff}

As described in Section~\ref{sec:trigSel} we rely on a
mixture of single and double lepton triggers.  The trigger
efficiency is very high because for most of the phase space 
we have two leptons each of which can fire a single lepton 
trigger -- and the single lepton triggers are very efficient.

We apply to MC events a simplified model of the trigger efficiency 
as a function of dilepton species ($ee$, $e\mu$, $\mu\mu$), the $P_T$ 
of the individual leptons, and, in the case of muons, the $|\eta|$
of the muons.  We believe that this model is adequate for
the trigger efficiency precision needed for this analysis.
Details are given in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_trigger}.

We take the trigger efficiency for $ee$ as 100\%.  The trigger efficiency
for the $e\mu$ and $\mu\mu$ final states is summarized in 
Figures~\ref{fig:emuModel} and~\ref{fig:mumuModel}.
We estimate the systematic uncertainties on the trigger modeling 
to be at the level of 1\%, which is approximately the difference in signal
yields between using 100\% trigger efficiency and the full trigger 
efficiency model.
