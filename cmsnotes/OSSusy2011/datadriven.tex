\section{Data Driven Background Estimation Methods}
\label{sec:datadriven}
We use 3 data-driven methods to 
estimate the background in the signal region.
The first one exploits the fact that 
\Ht\ and $y$ are nearly 
uncorrelated for the $t\bar{t}$ background 
(Section~\ref{sec:abcd});  the second one 
is based on the fact that in $t\bar{t}$ the
\pt\ of the dilepton pair is on average 
nearly the same as the \pt\ of the pair of neutrinos
from $W$-decays, which is reconstructed as \met\ in the
detector.

We study the closure of these methods using our madgraph \ttbar\ sample, as well as 
the powheg sample \\
TTTo2L2Nu2B\_7TeV-powheg-pythia6\_Spring11-PU\_S1\_START311\_V1G1-v1
which has approximately 10 times more events in the dilepton channel than the madgraph sample.
We use these samples to estimate correction factors and systematic uncertainties for the background predictions. 
However, the final choice of correction factors and uncertainties will be extracted from the Summer11 \ttbar\ madgraph
sample which will have 50 times as many events as the current madgraph sample. 
For the studies presented in this section, we do not apply trigger efficiency corrections or reweighting for
number of reconstructed vertices since are not comparing MC to data. 

\subsection{ABCD method}

We find that in $t\bar{t}$ events \Ht\ and 
$y$ are nearly uncorrelated, 
as demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:uncor} (left).
Thus, we can use an ABCD method in the $y$ vs. \Ht
plane to estimate the background in a data driven way. We dfine 4 regions in the 
plane of $y$ vs. \Ht, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:uncor}.
The region D is the signal region, and the regions A, B and C are control regions.
The predicted background in region D is given by $N_A \times N_C / N_B$.

In Table~\ref{tab:mcabcd}, we quote the MC expected yields for 1~fb$^{-1}$. In
general we find that the prediction agrees with the observed yield in the signal region within
$\sim$30-50\% for all signal regions. We also study the dependence of the ratio
of observed to predicted signal yields, as a function of the $y$ and \Ht\
requirements used to define the signal region.
Based on these results, we apply the
scale factors and uncertainties summarized in Table~\ref{tab:cor} to the
predicted background from the ABCD method.

\subsection{Dilepton $P_T$ method}
\label{sec:victory}
This method is based on a suggestion by V. Pavlunin\cite{ref:victory},
and was investigated by our group in 2009\cite{ref:ourvictory}.
The idea is that in dilepton $t\bar{t}$ events the lepton and neutrinos
from $W$ decays have the same $P_T$ spectrum (modulo $W$ polarization 
effects).  One can then use the observed 
$P_T(\ell\ell)$ distribution to model the sum of neutrino $P_T$'s which 
is identified with the \met.

Then, in order to predict the $t\bar{t} \to$ dilepton contribution to a 
selection with \met$+$X, one applies a cut on $P_T(\ell\ell)+$X instead.
In practice one has to rescale the result of the $P_T(\ell\ell)+$X selection
to account for the fact that any dilepton selection must include a 
moderate \met cut in order to reduce Drell Yan backgrounds.  This 
is discussed in Section 5.3 of Reference~\cite{ref:ourvictory}; for a \met
cut of 50 GeV, the rescaling factor is obtained from the MC as

\subsection{Opposite-Flavor Subtraction}
\label{sec:ofsubtraction}

The opposite-flavor subtraction technique exploits the fact that in \ttbar, the flavor
of the 2 leptons from $W$ decay are uncorrelated. Hence we expect equal rates of same-flavor (SF) 
$ee$ or $\mu\mu$ vs. opposite-flavor (OF) $e\mu$ lepton pairs. In SUSY, the lepton flavors may be 
correlated, producing an excess of same-flavor over opposite-flavor events. We use the observed 
yield in the OF final state to predict the yields in the SF final state according to:

\begin{center}
$N(ee)     = \frac{1}{2R_{\mu e}}N(e\mu)$ \\
$N(\mu\mu) = \frac{R_{\mu e}}{2}N(e\mu)$ \\
\end{center}

where $R_{\mu e} = X \pm Y$ is the ratio of muon to electron selection efficiencies.
This quantity has been evaluated by taking the ratio of the number of observed
$Z \to \mu^+\mu^-$ to $Z \to e^+e^-$ events in data, in the mass range 76-106 GeV
with no jets or \met\ requirements.
