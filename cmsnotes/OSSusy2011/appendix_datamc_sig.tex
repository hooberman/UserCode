\section{Data/MC Comparison: 2010 Signal Region}
\label{sec:appendix_datamc_sig}
Here we compare data and MC distributions for data passing the 
2010 signal region requirements (preselection + $y$ $>$ 8.5~GeV$^{1/2}$
+ \Ht\ $>$ 300~GeV. The high \pt\ dilepton trigger
data is used. We observe 45 events in this region.

All MC samples are scaled by an overall factor 1.13,
the ratio of the observed data yield in the preselection region to the
prediction from MC.
For illustration purposes, we overlay the distributions from the LM1
SUSY benchmakr point.
