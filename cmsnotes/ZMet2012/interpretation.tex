\section{Interpretation}

The results of this search will be interpreted in the context of simplified model spectra (SMS).
For the inclusive analysis, we will use the T5zz model depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:diagrams} (left).
For the targeted analysis, we will use the TChiWZ model depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:diagrams} (right),
and a GMSB model which produces a signature of \zzmet.
