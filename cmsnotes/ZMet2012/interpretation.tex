\section{Interpretation}

The results of this search will be interpreted in the context of simplified model spectra (SMS).
For the inclusive analysis, we will use the T5zz model depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:diagrams} (left).
For the targeted analysis, we will use the \wzmet\ model depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:diagrams} (right),
and a GMSB model which produces a signature of \zzmet. For the \wzmet\ model (GMSB \zzmet\ model), the results of this
analysis will be combined with the results of searches for charginos and neutralinos in the trilepton (quadlepton)
final state.
