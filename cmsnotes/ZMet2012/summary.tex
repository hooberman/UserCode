\section{Summary}

This note presents a search for BSM physics in final states with leptonically-decaying Z bosons, jets, and \MET. 
Two strategies were pursued. The first is an inclusive approach which targets BSM scenarios with Z bosons produced
in the decays of strongly-interacting particles. The second is a targeted approach which focuses on BSM scenarios
where the Z bosons are produced in the decays of weakly-interacting particles. The main backgrounds are
estimated with data-driven techniques. No excesses above the SM backgrounds are observed.
