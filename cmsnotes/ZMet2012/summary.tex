\section{Summary}

This note presents a search for BSM physics in final states with leptonically-decaying Z bosons, jets, and \MET. 
Two strategies were pursued. The first is an inclusive approach which targets BSM scenarios with Z bosons produced
in the decays of strongly-interacting particles. The second is a targeted approach which focuses on BSM scenarios
where the Z bosons are produced in the decays of weakly-interacting particles. The main backgrounds are
estimated with data-driven techniques. Good agreement is observed between the data and the predicted backgrounds
over the full \MET\ range, for both searches. 
%The results are interpreted in the context of a simplified SUSY
%model where chargino-neutralino pairs decay to the \wzmet\ final state, and used to place constraints on the
%masses of these particles.
