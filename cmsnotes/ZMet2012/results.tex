\section{Results}

In this section we provide the results of the inclusive and targeted searches. The observed and predicted \MET\ distributions for the
inclusive analysis are indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_incl}. A summary of the results in the signal regions is provided in
Table~\ref{tab:results_incl}. In the low \MET\ region (\MET\ $<$ 100 GeV) which is dominated by the \zjets\ background, the observed
yields are in good agreement with the predicted background. This is also the case in the high \MET\ region (\MET\ $>$ 200 GeV).
In the moderate \MET\ region (100 $<$ \MET $<$ 200 GeV) we observe a slight excess in the data with respect to the predicted background.
Taking into account the full uncertainty on the background prediction, the significance of the excess is about 1.3$\sigma$. 
The separate results for the ee and $\mu\mu$ channels are presented in App.~\ref{app:results}. For this \MET\ region, we find an excess
of 1.4$\sigma$ in the ee channel and 0.7$\sigma$ in the $\mu\mu$ channel.

The observed and predicted \MET\ distributions for the
targeted analysis are indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_targ}. A summary of the results in the signal regions is provided in
Table~\ref{tab:results_targ}. The observed yields are in good agreement with the predicted background in all signal regions.
