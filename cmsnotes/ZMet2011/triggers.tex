\section{Triggers}
\label{sec:trigSel}

For data, we use a cocktail of unprescaled single 
and double lepton triggers. An event
in the $ee$ final state is required to pass at least one
single or double electron trigger, a
$\mu\mu$ event is required to pass at least one single 
or double muon trigger, while an $e\mu$ event
is required to pass at least one single muon, single electron, 
or $e-\mu$ cross trigger. ($e\mu$ events are retained in a control sample used to estimate the ttbar contribution as described in Section~\ref{sec:topbkg})

The detailed list of triggers used for selecting dilepton events can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:trigsel},
and we evaluate the efficiency using the same trigger model discussed in~\cite{ref:GenericOS}.
Triggers used for creation of photon templates are listed in Section~\ref{sec:templates}.
