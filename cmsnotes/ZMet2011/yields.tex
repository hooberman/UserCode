\section{Preselection yields}
\label{sec:yields}

Based on the event and trigger selections described in~Section \ref{sec:eventSelection}, 
we define a preselection as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of jets $\geq$ 2
\item All dilepton flavor combinations (SF as well as OF)
\item Dilepton mass within 10~GeV of the Z mass
%\item Dilepton mass within 15~GeV of the \Z mass
\end{itemize}
The resulting dilepton mass spectra for the $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ final states are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dilmass}.

The data yields and the MC predictions are given in Table~\ref{preselyieldtable}.

The MC yields are normalized to \lumi\ using the cross-sections
from Reference~\cite{ref:xsec} assuming 100\% trigger efficiency 
%{\bf(will have to fix this next pass)} 
.
As anticipated, the MC predicts that the preselection is dominated by Z+jets in the same-flavor 
case and by \ttbar in the opposite-flavor case.  
The data yield is in reasonable agreement with the predictions for the $ee$, $\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$ channels.
We also show the next-to-leading order (NLO) yields for the LM4 and LM8 processes, which are benchmark
SUSY processes in which $Z$ bosons are produced via cascade decays of SUSY particles. 

%, while an excess of 
%data events is observed in the $\mu\mu$ case. 
%We believe that this is due to a slightly harder njet distribution in data vs MC, combined with a slight 
%deficiency of electron yield with respect to MC. {\bf Reevaluate w new mc}

%I'm replacing below with above

%{\bf NOTE: This excess was not understood, and we investigated it a bit.
%In the 11/pb sample it is a difference between the Njet spectra between e/mu. It mostly went away in the 35/pb sample. We do see a difference in yield in the later data between e/mu, though - To be investigated. Maybe reReco will fix that. }
