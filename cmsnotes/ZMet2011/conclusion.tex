\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have performed a search for BSM physics in the Z plus jets plus MET final state.
Backgrounds from SM \Z production were estimated using the data-driven
MET templates method, and backgrounds from $t\bar{t}$ were estimated using
the data-driven opposite-flavor subtraction technique. We found no evidence
for anomalous yield beyond SM expectations and placed \statistics\ 95\% CL upper limits
on the non SM yields in the loose (MET$>$\signalmetl~GeV) and tight signal regions (MET$>$\signalmett~GeV)
of \ulloose~and \ultight~events, respectively. 
%We also quoted expected yields for the 
We also quote upper limits on the quantity

benchmark SUSY processes LM4 and LM8
including estimated signal efficiencies and systematics, 
and conclude that LM4 is not compatible with the data and therefore ruled out.
