\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have performed a search for BSM physics in the Z + jets + MET final state.
Backgrounds from SM Z production were estimated using the data-driven
MET templates method, and backgrounds from $t\bar{t}$ were estimated using
the data-driven opposite-flavor subtraction technique. We found no evidence
for anomalous yield beyond SM expectations and placed Bayesian 95\% CL upper limits
on the non SM yields in the loose (MET$>$60 GeV) and tight signal regions (MET$>$120 GeV),
of 7.9 and 3.0 events, respectively. We also quoted upper limits on the quantity
$\sigma \times BF \times A$, assuming efficiencies and uncertainties from the benchmark
SUSY processes LM4 and LM8.
