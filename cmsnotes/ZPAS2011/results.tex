The data and SM predictions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pfmet_eemm} and summarized in Table~\ref{tab:results}.
In the loose signal region MET $>$ 100 GeV, we observe 14 events (7 $ee$ and 7 $\mu\mu$)
compared to a data-driven prediction of 13.6 $\pm$ 1.1 (stat) $\pm$ X (syst),
which is dominated by the estimated \ttbar contribution. 
For the tight signal region MET $>$ \signalmett GeV, 
we observe 2 events (both in the $\mu\mu$ channel) compared to a 
data-driven prediction of 1.3 $\pm$ 0.3 (stat) $\pm$ (syst).
We conclude that no evidence for an anomalous event yield above the data-driven prediction is observed.
