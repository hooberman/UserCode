\section{Additional Information for Model Testing}
\label{sec:outreach}

Other models of new physics in the dilepton final state can be confronted in an approximate way by simple 
generator-level studies that compare the expected number of events in 34.0~pb$^{-1}$
with our upper limits of 7.9 events (loose signal region) and 3.0 events (tight signal regions).  
The key ingredients of such studies are the kinematic cuts described 
in this note, the lepton efficiencies, and the detector response for MET.

%{\bf In the following, I am using ttbar as a `baseline' to quote ID/iso efficiencies.
%\bf Should I instead use, for example, Z+$\geq$2 jet events?}
The muon identification efficiency is $\approx 92\%$;
the electron identification efficiency varies from $\approx$ 86\% at 
$P_T = 20$~GeV to 93\% for $P_T > 50$~GeV (see Fig.~\ref{fig:effttbar} top).

The lepton isolation efficiency varies with lepton momentum, as well as the jet activity in the event.
In $t\bar{t}$ events, it varies from $\approx 87\%$ (muons)
and $\approx 90\%$ (electrons) at $P_T=20$~GeV to $\approx 95\%$ for $P_T>60$~GeV. 
In LM4 (LM8) events, this efficiency is degraded by $\approx 2-5$\% ($\approx 10-13$\%) over the whole momentum 
spectrum (see Fig.~\ref{fig:effttbar} bottom).

The average detector response (the reconstructed quantity normalized to the generated quantity) 
for MET is $0.96 \pm X$ where the uncertainties originate from the hadronic energy scale uncertainty.
The experimental resolution on this quantity is 17\%.
