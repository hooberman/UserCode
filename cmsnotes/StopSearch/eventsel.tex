This analysis uses several different control regions in addition to the signal regions. 
All of these different regions are defined in this section. 
%Figure~\ref{fig:venndiagram} illustrates the relationship between these regions.

\subsection{Single Lepton Selection}

[UPDATE SELECTION]

The single lepton preselection sample is based on the following criteria
\begin{itemize}
\item satisfy the trigger requirement (see
  Table.~\ref{tab:DatasetsData}). Dilepton triggers are used only for the dilepton control region.
\item select events with one high \pt\ electron or muon, requiring
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\pt>30~\GeVc$ and $|\eta|<2.1$
  \item satisfy the identification and isolation requirements detailed
    in the same-sign SUSY analysis (SUS-11-010) for electrons and the opposite-sign 
    SUSY analysis (SUS-11-011) for muons
  \end{itemize} 
  \item require at least 4 PF jets in the event with $\pt>30~\GeV$
    within $|\eta|<2.5$ out of which at least 1 satisfies the CSV
    medium working point b-tagging requirement
  \item require moderate $\met>50~\GeV$
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tab:preselectionyield} shows the yields in data and MC without any corrections for this preselection region.

\end{table}

\subsection{Signal Region Selection}

The signal regions (SRs) are selected to improve the sensitivity for the
single lepton requirements and cover a range of scalar top
scenarios. The \mt\ and \met\ variables are used to define the signal
regions and the requirements are listed in Table~\ref{tab:srdef}. 

\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
\hline
Signal Region & Minimum \mt\ [GeV] & Minimum \met\ [GeV] \\
\hline
\hline
SRA & 150 & 100 \\
SRB & 120 & 150 \\
SRC & 120 & 200 \\
SRD & 120 & 250 \\
SRE & 120 & 300 \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{ Signal region definitions based on \mt\ and \met\
  requirements. These requirements are applied in addition to the
  baseline single lepton selection.
\label{tab:srdef}}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:srrawmcyields} shows the expected number of SM
background yields for the SRs. A few stop signal yields for four
values of the parameters are also shown for comparison. The signal
regions with looser requirements are sensitive to lower stop masses
M(\sctop), while those with tighter requirements are more sensitive to
higher M(\sctop).

\subsection{Control Region Selection}

Control regions (CRs) are used to validate the background estimation
procedure and derive systematic uncertainties for some
contributions. The CRs are selected to have similar
kinematics to the SRs, but have a different requirement in terms of
number of b-tags and number of leptons, thus enhancing them in
different SM contributions. The four CRs used in this analysis are
summarized in Table~\ref{tab:crdef}.

\subsection{MC Corrections}

[UPDATE SECTION]

\subsubsection{Corrections to Jets and \met}

The official recommendations from the Jet/MET group are used for 
the data and MC samples. In particular, the jet
energy corrections (JEC) are updated using the official recipe.
L1FastL2L3Residual (L1FastL2L3) corrections are applied for data (MC),
based on the global tags GR\_R\_42\_V23 (DESIGN42\_V17) for
data (MC). In addition, these jet energy corrections are propagated to
the \met\ calculation, following the official prescription for
deriving the Type I corrections. 

Events with anomalous ``rho'' pile-up corrections are excluded from the sample since these 
correspond to events with unphysically large \met\ and \mt\ tail
signal region. In addition, the recommended MET filters are applied. 


\subsubsection{Branching Fraction Correction}

The leptonic branching fraction used in some of the \ttbar\ MC samples
differs from the value listed in the PDG $(10.80 \pm 0.09)\%$. 
Table.~\ref{tab:wlepbf} summarizes the branching fractions used in
the generation of the various \ttbar\ MC samples. 
For \ttbar\ samples with the incorrect leptonic branching fraction, event
weights are applied based on the number of true leptons and the ratio
of the corrected and incorrect branching fractions. 

\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\hline
         \ttbar\ Sample - Event Generator & Leptonic Branching Fraction\\

Pythia         &       0.108\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Leptonic branching fractions for the various \ttbar\ samples

  Madgraph has a branching fraction that is almost $3\%$ higher than
  the PDG value. \label{tab:wlepbf}}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Modeling of Additional Hard Jets in Top Dilepton Events}
\label{sec:jetmultiplicity}

[SUMMARIZE, UPDATE]

Dilepton \ttbar\ events have 2 jets from the top decays, so additional
jets from radiation or higher order contributions are required to
enter the signal sample. The modeling of addtional jets in \ttbar\
events is checked in a \ttll\ control sample,
selected by requiring
\begin{itemize}
\item exactly 2 selected electrons or muons with \pt $>$ 20 GeV
\item \met\ $>$ 100 GeV
\item $\geq1$ b-tagged jet
\item Z-veto 
\end{itemize}
Figure~\ref{fig:dileptonnjets} shows a comparison of the jet
multiplicity distribution in data and MC for this two-lepton control
sample. After requiring at least 1 b-tagged jet, most of the
events have 2 jets, as expected from the dominant process \ttll. There is also a
significant fraction of events with additional jets. 
The 3-jet sample is mainly comprised of \ttbar\ events with 1 additional
emission and similarly the $\ge4$-jet sample contains primarily
$\ttbar+\ge2$ jet events. Even though the primary \ttbar\
Madgraph sample used includes up to 3 additional partons at the Matrix
Element level, which are intended to describe additional hard jets,
Figure~\ref{fig:dileptonnjets} shows a slight mis-modeling of the
additional jets. 


\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{plots/njets_all_met100_mueg.pdf}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{plots/njets_all_met100_diel.pdf}%

	\caption{

          Comparison of the jet multiplicity distribution in data and MC for dilepton events in the \E-\M\
          (top), \E-\E\ (bottom left) and \M-\M\ (bottom right) channels.}  
      \end{center}
\end{figure}

It should be noted that in the case of \ttll\ events
with a single reconstructed lepton, the other lepton may be
mis-reconstructed as a jet. For example, a hadronic tau may be
mis-identified as a jet (since no $\tau$ identification is used). 
In this case only 1 additional jet from radiation may suffice for 
a \ttll\ event to enter the signal sample. As a result, both the
samples with $\ttbar+1$ jet and $\ttbar+\ge2$ jets are relevant for
estimating the top dilepton bkg in the signal region.

%In this section we discuss a correction to $ N_{2 lep}^{MC} $ in Equation XXX
%due to differences in the modelling of the jet multiplicity in data versus MC.
%The same correction also enters $ N_{peak}^{MC}$ in Equation XXX to the extend that the 
%dilepton contributions to $ N_{peak}^{MC}$ gets corrected.

%The dilepton control sample is defined by the following requirements:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Exactly 2 selected electrons or muons with \pt $>$ 20 GeV
%\item \met\ $>$ 50 GeV
%\item $\geq1$ b-tagged jet
%\end{itemize}
%
%This sample is dominated by \ttll. The distribution of \njets\ for data and MC passing this selection is displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:dilepton_njets}. 
%We use this distribution to derive scale factors which reweight the \ttll\ MC \njets\ distribution to match the data. We define the following
%quantities
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $N_{2}=$ data yield minus non-dilepton \ttbar\ MC yield for \njets\ $\leq$ 2
%\item $N_{3}=$ data yield minus non-dilepton \ttbar\ MC yield for \njets\ = 3
%\item $N_{4}=$ data yield minus non-dilepton \ttbar\ MC yield for \njets\ $\geq$ 4
%\item $M_{2}=$ dilepton \ttbar\ MC yield for \njets\ $\leq$ 2
%\item $M_{3}=$ dilepton \ttbar\ MC yield for \njets\ = 3
%\item $M_{4}=$ dilepton \ttbar\ MC yield for \njets\ $\geq$ 4
%\end{itemize}
%
%We use these yields to define 3 scale factors, which quantify the data/MC ratio in the 3 \njets\ bins:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $SF_2 = N_2 / M_2$
%\item $SF_3 = N_3 / M_3$
%\item $SF_4 = N_4 / M_4$
%\end{itemize}
%
%And finally, we define the scale factors $K_3$ and $K_4$:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $K_3 = SF_3 / SF_2$
%\item $K_4 = SF_4 / SF_2$
%\end{itemize}
%
%The scale factor $K_3$ is extracted from dilepton \ttbar\ events with \njets = 3, which have exactly 1 ISR jet.
%The scale factor $K_4$ is extracted from dilepton \ttbar\ events with \njets $\geq$ 4, which have at least 2 ISR jets.
%Both of these scale factors are needed since dilepton \ttbar\ events which fall in our signal region (including
%the \njets $\geq$ 4 requirement) may require exactly 1 ISR jet, in the case that the second lepton is reconstructed
%as a jet, or at least 2 ISR jets, in the case that the second lepton is not reconstructed as a jet. These scale
%factors are applied to the dilepton \ttbar\ MC only. For a given MC event, we determine whether to use $K_3$ or $K_4$
%by counting the number of reconstructed jets in the event ($N_{\rm{jets}}^R$) , and subtracting off any reconstructed 
%jet which is matched to the second lepton at generator level ($N_{\rm{jets}}^\ell$); $N_{\rm{jets}}^{\rm{cor}} = N_{\rm{jets}}^R - N_{\rm{jets}}^\ell$.
%For events with $N_{\rm{jets}}^{\rm{cor}}=3$ the factor $K_3$ is applied, while for events with $N_{\rm{jets}}^{\rm{cor}}\geq4$ the factor $K_4$ is applied.
%For all subsequent steps, the scale factors $K_3$ and $K_4$ have been
%applied to the \ttll\ MC.


Table~\ref{tab:njetskfactors}  shows scale factors to correct the
fraction of events with additional jets in MC to the observed fraction
in data. These are applied to the \ttll\ MC throughout the entire analysis, i.e. whenever \ttll\ MC is used to estimate or subtract
a yield or distribution. 
%
In order to do so, it is first necessary to count the number of
additional jets from radiation and exclude leptons mis-identified as
jets. A jet is considered a mis-identified lepton if it is matched to a
generator-level second lepton with sufficient energy to satisfy the jet
\pt\ requirement ($\pt>30~\GeV$).

\end{figure}


In the signal sample, leptons mis-identified as jets are not rare. 
Figure~\ref{fig:dileptonnjets_lepcomp}  shows the MC jet
multiplicity distribution for \ttll\ events satisfying the full
selection criteria before and after subtracting leptons mis-identified
as jets. Approximately a quarter of the sample is comprised of 4-jet
events that actually correspond to a 2-lepton + 3 jet event where the second
lepton is counted as a jet. Lepton mis-identification depends strongly
on the type of second lepton, occuring more frequently in the case of
hadronic $\tau$s than leptonic objects. According to the \ttll\
MC, for hadronic $\tau$s, $\sim85\%$ of multi-prong $\tau$s and about half
the single-prong $\tau$ are mis-identified as jets. In the case of
leptonic objects, the fractions are smaller, comprising about a third
of \E/\M\ from a \W\ decay and $<20\%$ for leptonic $\tau$s, 
mainly because of the softness of the decay products. 
The scale factors listed in Table.~\ref{tab:njetskfactors} are applied
to the ``cleaned'' jet counts in the signal sample (shown in blue in
Figure~\ref{fig:dileptonnjets_lepcomp}). The impact of applying the
jet multiplicity scale factors on the \ttll\ is about a $10\%$ reduction in the
background prediction for the signal region. 

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Hadronic ($\tau$) objects: most multi-prong $\tau$s and about
%  half single-prong $\tau$s 
%\item Leptonic objects: smaller fraction, 
%\end{itemize}
%Fraction of various lepton types matched to a jet
%multi-prong taus ⟹ 85% give additional 30 GeV jet
%single-prong taus ⟹ ~50% give additional 30 GeV jet
%leptonic taus ⟹ <20% give additional 30 GeV jet
%e/mu⟹ ~40% give additional 30 GeV jet

          sample (with two reconstructed leptons) and the signal
          sample (with one reconstructed lepton). The distributions
          show good agreement, indicating that the usage of the
          reconstructed jet multiplicity in one sample to reweight the
        signal sample is indeed justified. {\bf Fix me: Is this before or after the isolated track veto?}}  
      \end{center}
\end{figure}

Ultimately, the interesting quantity for reweighting is the number of
additional hard jets from radiation and this information is accessed using the
number of reconstructed
jets. Figure~\ref{fig:dileptonnjets_signalcontrol_comp} 
demonstrates in MC that the \ttll\ control sample, i.e. when both leptons are reconstructed,
can indeed be used to reweight the \ttll\ signal sample, i.e. when one lepton is missed.
The figure compares the
number of additional jets from truth matching probed by N
reconstructed jets, in this case 3 and $\ge4$ jets. In order to do so,
jets that are truth-matched to the top decay products (the b-quarks
and additional leptons) are removed. The 3-jet distribution shows 
excellent agreement and the differences in the $\ge4$-jet distribution 
are at most $5\%$. The impact of possible differences in the
underlying distribution of extra
jets between the signal and control \ttll\ samples are estimated by
varying the scale factor contributions by $10\%$ and calculating the
change in the dilepton prediction. This effect is found to have a
negligible impact on the prediction, well below $1\%$.

Other effects that have been examined include the impact of 
additional jets from pileup that may bias the jet multiplicity
distribution, which  is found to be a negligible effect in this dataset. The
impact of the non-\ttll\ background on the jet fraction scale factors
has also been studied. In particular, given the large uncertainty on
the $\dy+HF$ MC prediction, this component has been varied by a factor
of 2 and the resulting change on the dilepton prediction is $<1\%$. As
a result, the dominant source of uncertainty is the statistical
uncertainty, primarily from the two-lepton control sample size, that
corresponds to a $3\%$ uncertainty on the dilepton prediction. 

The scale factors for the fraction of additional jets in the dilepton
sample are applied throughout the analysis. It may be noted that this
scaling is also performed consistently for the alternative \ttbar\
samples, always reweighting the jet multiplicity distribution to the
data in the \ttll\ control sample. In this way, effects truly
arising from using different MC samples and settings can be examined,
separately from issues related to the modeling of additional jets. 

\subsubsection{Efficiency Corrections}

[TO BE UDPATED WITH T\&P STUDIES ON ID, TRIGGER ETC]


\subsubsection{Dilepton control regions}

We define a dilepton control region requiring two isolated leptons, $ee, e\mu$, or $\mu\mu$ to study the jet multiplicity in data and MC, and derive
scale factors based on their consistency. This study is documented in Section~\ref{sec:jetmultiplicity}.

In this region we require:
\begin{itemize}
\item dilepton triggers
\item two leptons with $\pt > 20 \GeV$ that pass our lepton id and isolation
\item $\met > 50 \GeV$
\item $\ge 1$ b-tag, SSV medium
\end{itemize}

This sample is only partially overlapping with the single lepton preselection as it requires the dilepton rather than the single lepton triggers, and
differs in the $\pt$ requirement for the leading lepton. Table~\ref{tab:dileptonyield} shows the raw yields in data and MC prior to any corrections.
