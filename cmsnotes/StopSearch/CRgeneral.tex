The CR studies described in this Section are key to validating the
background predictions.  The CRs are defined in Section~\ref{sec:CRsel}.

CR1 and CR2 are designed to test the $M_T$ tail in $W +$ jets and 
\ttbar\ respectively.  Note that, as explained in Section~\ref{sec:ljbg-general},
these tails are different in the two samples because the off-shell effects
are much more pronounced for $W +$ jets (the s- and t-channel single 
top have the same $M_T$ tail as \ttbar).  To put things in perspective, 
keep in mind that these
backgrounds are only about 15\% of the total, see Table~\ref{tab:srrawmcyields}.

CR4 and CR5 address the dominant \ttbar\ dilepton background.
In CR4 we test the $M_T$ tail in well identified dilepton events.
In CR5 we test the same quantity, but in events where the second lepton is identified
as an isolated track.  Clearly CR4 and CR5 overlap.
