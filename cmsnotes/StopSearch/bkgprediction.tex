[THIS IS WHERE THE NUMBERS TO DERIVE THE BACKGROUND ESTIMATES ARE DUMPED AND THE CALCULATION EXPLAINED]

Here we give the details of how we arrive at the background prediction
in a given signal region.  Here we concentrate on the method used
to arrive at the central value of the background prediction.  The
systematic
uncertainties will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:systematics}.

As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:overview}, we normalize the main
$t\bar{t}$
background to the $M_T$ peak.  This is actually a bit tricky because 
we want to minimize the effect of the isolated track veto on 
lepton $+$ jets events, which may not be terribly well reproduced.
Thus, we define two normaliztion region in the $M_T$ peak ($60 < M_T < 100$~GeV),
one before and one after the application of the isolated track veto.

The dominant dilepton background is normalized to the pre-veto normalization
region.  A pre-veto scale factor ($SF_{pre}$) is defined as a common scale
factors that needs to be applied to the $t\bar{t}$, single-top, and 
$W +$ jets
MC to make the data yield in the pre-veto normalization agree with
the MC prediction (the small rare MC component is held fixed).
Then, the dilepton background prediction is obtained by multiplying the
dilepton BG Monte Carlo by $SF_{pre}$.

The $t\bar{t}$ lepton $+$ jet BG is normalized to post-veto 
normalization region.  A post-veto scale factor  ($SF_{post}$) 
is defined in (almost) the same way as the pre-veto scale factor.
The difference here is that this scale factor applies only to 
the lepton $+$ jets components and not the dilepton component,
since that component is already rescaled by $SF_{pre}$.  
This procedure minimizes the reliance on the understanding of 
the isolated track veto.
Then the  $t\bar{t}$ lepton $+$ jet BG is obtained by taking the 
number of MC-predicted $t\bar{t}$ lepton $+$ jets in the post-veto
normalization region, scaling it by $SF_{post}$, multiplying 
it by the tail-to-peak ratio $R_{top}$ of Table~\ref{tab:ttp}, and
finally the data-MC scale factor $SFR_{top}$ from
Table~\ref{tab:cr2yields}.

The single top background is obtained in exactly the same way
as the  $t\bar{t}$ lepton $+$ jet BG, using the same tail-to-peak
ratio and the same data-MC scale-factor.  The $W$ background is
done in a similar way, but using a different tail-to-peak ratio 
($R_{wjets}$ of Table~\ref{tab:ttp}), and a different data-MC scale
factor
($SFR_{wjet}$ from
Table~\ref{tab:cr1yields}).

Other (small) backgrounds are taken straight from Monte Carlo, as 
described in Section~\ref{sec:bkg_other}.

%POSSIBLY ADD SOME EQUATIONS TO MAKE IT MORE EXPLICIT HOW THE CALCULATION IS DERIVED
%We consider three samples:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Dilepton sample (exactly 2 selected leptons): used to correct the \njets\ distribution in \ttll\ MC, which is not necessarily well-modelled since ISR jets 
%are needed to satisfy the \njets $\geq$ 4 requirement defining the signal region;
%\item Inclusive sample (at least 1 selected lepton): used to define a
%  scale factor which corrects for effects of integrated luminosity,
%  \ttbar\ cross section, jet energy scale and jet selection efficiencies, lepton selection and trigger efficiencies.
%\item Signal sample (exactly 1 selected lepton): this is the sample used to define the signal region. In addition, this sample is used to determine a scale 
%factor accounting for possible data vs. MC discrepancies in the isolated track fake rate for backgrounds which have only 1 genuine lepton.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsection{Step 1: Use dilepton control sample to correct the \njets\ distributon in \ttll\ MC}
%

% 
%\subsection{Step 2: Use the pre-veto sample to define a data-to-MC scale factor}
%
%The pre-veto sample is defined by the following requirements
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item At least 1 selected electron (muon) with \pt $>$ 30 GeV and $|\eta|<2.5$ ($|\eta|<2.1$)
%\item At least 4 selected jets, with at least 1 b-tagged jet
%\item \met\ $>$ 50 GeV
%\end{itemize}
%
%Thus all selection criteria are applied with the exception of the veto on events containing an isolated track. 
%This sample is dominated by \ttlj\, with secondary contributions from \wjets\ and \ttll\ . 
%%The largest contribution to this sample is \ttlj, but \wjets\ and \ttll\ also have significant contributions.
%This sample is used to define an overall data over MC scale factor ($SF$) in the peak control region, 
%that accounts for differences between the data and the MC due to the luminosity estimate, the lepton 
%efficiencies and so on and is thus applied to the full MC cocktail. 
%To do so we define for the pre-veto sample (labeled `all'):
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $N_{\rm{peak}}^{\rm{all}}$ = data yield in the peak region $60<\mt<100$ GeV
%\item $M_{\rm{peak}}^{\rm{all}}$ = MC yield in the peak region $60<\mt<100$ GeV
%\item $SF^{\rm{all}} = N_{\rm{peak}}^{\rm{all}} / M_{\rm{peak}}^{\rm{all}}$
%\end{itemize}
%
%For all subsequent steps, the scale factor $SF^{\rm{all}}$ is applied to all MC contributions.
%
%\subsection{Step 3: Isolated Track Veto Efficiency Correction}
%
%The signal sample is defined by the same requirements as the pre-veto sample, except that we veto events containing
%an isolated track. The background is the inclusive sample can be split into 2 contributions:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Dilepton background: mostly \ttll.
%\item Single lepton background: mostly \ttlj\ and \wjets;
%\end{itemize}
%
%The isolated track veto impacts these 2 contributions in different ways. For the dilepton background, the veto
%rejects events which have a genuine 2nd lepton, so applying the isolated track veto scales the dilepton background
%by the efficiency $\epsilon(trk)$ to identify the isolated track. For the single lepton background, the veto rejects events
%which do not have a genuine 2nd lepton but which have a ``fake'' isolated track, so the isolated track veto scales
%the single lepton background by (1-FR), where FR is the ``fake rate'' to identify an isolated track in events which 
%contain no genuine 2nd lepton. 
%
%The isolated track efficiency $\epsilon$ can be measured in data and MC using $Z\to\ell\ell$ tag-and-probe studies. 
%We therefore use the tag-and-probe studies to apply a correction to the \ttll\ MC. 
%A measurement of the FR in data is non-trivial, but we can account for differences between the data and the MC by scaling 
%only the single lepton background in the \mt\ peak region after applying the isolated track veto.
%
%In detail, the procedure to correct the dilepton background is:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Using tag-and-probe studies, we plot the distribution of {\bf absolute} track isolation for identified probe electrons
%and muons {\bf TODO: need to compare the e vs. $\mu$ track iso distributions, they might differ due to e$\to$e$\gamma$}.
%\item We verify that the distribution of absolute track isolation does not depend on the \pt\ of the probe lepton.
%This is due to the fact that this isolation is from ambient PU and jet activity in the event, which is uncorrelated with
%the lepton \pt {\bf TODO: verify this in data and MC.}.
%\item Our requirement is {\bf relative} track isolation $<$ 0.1. For a given \ttll\ MC event, we determine the \pt of the 2nd
%lepton and translate this to find the corresponding requirement on the {\bf absolute} track isolation, which is simply $0.1\times$\pt.
%\item We measure the efficiency to satisfy this requirement in data and MC, and define a scale-factor $SF_{\epsilon(trk)}$ which
%is the ratio of the data-to-MC efficiencies. This scale-factor is applied to the \ttll\ MC event.
%\item {\bf THING 2 we are unsure about: we can measure this SF for electrons and for muons, but we can't measure it for hadronic 
%tracks from $\tau$ decays. Verena has showed that the absolute track isolation distribution in hadronic $\tau$ tracks is harder due 
%to $\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma$ with $\gamma\to e^+e^-$.}
%\end{itemize} 
%
%At this point we are done applying scale factors to the dilepton background. We next apply a scale factor to the single lepton background. We use the following quantities:
%
%%Use the signal sample to apply a correction factor to the single lepton background
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $N_{\rm{peak}}^{\rm{veto}}$ =  data yield in the peak region $60<\mt<100$ GeV
%\item $M^{\ell,\rm{veto}}_{\rm{peak}}$ =  single lepton background MC in the peak region $60<\mt<100$ GeV
%\item $M^{\ell\ell,\rm{veto}}_{\rm{peak}}$ =  dilepton background MC in the peak region $60<\mt<100$ GeV
%\item $SF_{\ell}^{\rm{veto}} = (N_{\rm{peak}}^{\rm{veto}} - M^{\ell\ell,\rm{veto}}_{\rm{peak}} SF_{\epsilon(trk)} )/ M^{\ell,\rm{veto}}_{\rm{peak}}$
%\end{itemize}
%
%The scale factor $SR_{\ell}$ is applied to the single lepton background to account for potential data vs. MC discrepancies 
%in the isolated track veto.
%
%To summarize, the dilepton and single lepton background prediction in the signal region (\mt\ $>150$ GeV) are given by
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\rm{P}^{\ell\ell}_{\rm{sig}} = SF^{\rm{all}} \times SF_{\epsilon(trk)} \times M^{\ell \ell}_{\rm{sig}}$
%\item $\rm{P}^{\ell}_{\rm{sig}} = SF^{\rm{all}} \times SF_{\ell}^{\rm{veto}} \times M^{\ell}_{\rm{sig}}$
%\end{itemize}
%
%where $M_{\rm{sig}}$ correspond to the Monte Carlo predictions in the tail of the distributions and the $SF$ terms are data over MC scale factors to account 
%for differences between the data and the MC for the following effects
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $SF^{\rm{all}} \rightarrow $ effects impacting the normalization with the exception of the isolated track veto i.e. luminosity, 
%lepton identification and trigger efficiencies $\dots$
%\item $SF_{\epsilon(trk)} \rightarrow $ the track veto efficiency for real second leptons
%\item $SF_{\ell}^{\rm{veto}} \rightarrow $ the inefficiency introduced by the track veto on events without a second lepton (1-FR defined previously)
%\end{itemize}
%
%%SF_{\ell}^{\rm{post-veto}}$ 
%%\item $M^{\ell,\rm{sig}}_{\rm{peak}}$ =  single lepton background MC in the peak region $60<\mt<100$ GeV
