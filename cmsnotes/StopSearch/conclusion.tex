This note presents a search for the production of stop quark pairs in events with a 
single isolated lepton, several jets, missing transverse energy, and
large transverse mass. The dataset used corresponds to an integrated
luminosity of \lumi\ at center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. Seven signal
regions are defined, based on \met\ and \mt\ requirements. Agreement is
observed between the data and the predicted backgrounds for all signal
regions. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified SUSY
models where the stops decay to top-neutralino or b-chargino and are
used to place constraints on the stop mass.
