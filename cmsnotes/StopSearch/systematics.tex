\section{Systematics Uncertainties in the Background Prediction}
\label{sec:systematics}

The methodology for determining the systematics on the background
predictions has not changed with respect to the nominal analysis.
Because the template method has not changed, the same 
systematic uncertainty is assessed on this prediction (32\%).
The 50\% uncertainty on the WZ and ZZ background is also unchanged.
The systematic uncertainty in the OF background prediction based on 
e$\mu$ events has changed, due to the different composition of this
sample after vetoing events containing b-tagged jets.

As in the nominal analysis, we do not require the e$\mu$ events
to satisfy the dilepton mass requirement and apply a scaling factor K,
extracted from MC, to account for the fraction of e$\mu$ events
which satisfy the dilepton mass requirement. This procedure is used
in order to improve the statistical precision of the OF background estimate.

For the selection used in the nominal analysis, 
the e$\mu$ sample is completely dominated by $t\bar{t}$
events, and we observe that K is statistically consistent with constant with
respect to the \MET\ requirement. However, in this analysis, the $t\bar{t}$
background is strongly suppressed by the b-veto, and hence the non-$t\bar{t}$
backgrounds (specifically, $Z\to\tau\tau$ and VV) become more relevant. 
At low \MET, the $Z\to\tau\tau$ background is pronounced, while $t\bar{t}$
and VV dominate at high \MET\ (see App.~\ref{app:kinemu}).
Therefore, the sample composition changes
as the \MET\ requirement is varied, and as a result K depends
on the \MET\ requirement. 

We thus measure K in MC separately for each
\MET\ requirement, as displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:kvmet} (left).
%The systematic uncertainty on K is determined separately for each \MET\
%requirement by comparing the relative difference in K in data vs. MC.
The values of K used are the MC predictions 
%and the total systematic uncertainty on the OF prediction 
%as shown in 
(Table \ref{fig:kvmettable}).
The contribution to the total OF prediction systematic uncertainty 
from K is assessed from the ratio of K in data and MC,
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:kvmet} (right).
The ratio is consistent with unity to roughly 17\%, 
so we take this value as the systematic from K.
17\% added in quadrature with 7\% from 
the electron to muon efficieny ratio 
(as assessed in the inclusive analysis)
yields a total systematic of $\sim$18\% 
which we round up to 20\%.
For \MET\ $>$ 150, there are no OF events in data inside the Z mass window
so we take a systematic based on the statistical uncertainty
of the MC prediction for K. 
This value is 25\% for \MET\ $>$ 150 GeV and 60\% for \MET\ $>$ 200 GeV.
%Although we cannot check the value of K in data for \MET\ $>$ 150
%because we find no OF events inside the Z mass window for this \MET\ 
%cut, the overall OF yields with no dilepton mass requirement 
%agree to roughly 20\% (9 data vs 7.0 $\pm$ 1.1 MC).


%Below Old

%In reevaluating the systematics on the OF prediction, however,
%we observed a different behavior of K as a function of \MET\ 
%as was seen in the inclusive analysis. 

%Recall that K is the ratio of the number of \emu\ events
%inside the Z window to the total number of \emu\ events.
%In the inclusive analysis, it is taken from \ttbar\ MC
%and used to scale the inclusive \emu\ yield in data.
%The yield scaled by K is then corrected for 
%the $e$ vs $\mu$ efficiency difference to obtain the 
%final OF prediction.

%Based on the plot in figure \ref{fig:kvmet}, 
%we choose to use a different
%K for each \MET\ cut and assess a systematic uncertainty
%on the OF prediction based on the difference between 
%K in data and MC. 
%The variation of K as a function of \MET\ is caused 
%by a change in sample composition with increasing \MET.
%At \MET\ $<$ 60 GeV, the contribution of Z plus jets is
%not negligible (as it was in the inclusive analysis)
%because of the b veto. (See appendix \ref{app:kinemu}.)
%At higher \MET, \ttbar\ and diboson backgrounds dominate.
