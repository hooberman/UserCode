\begin{itemize}
\item Fixed bug in calculation of \wzmet\ signal efficiency, as reported in~\cite{HNbug}.
\item Updated to official recipe for JEC and related uncertainties (see Sec.~\ref{sec:eventSelection}).
\item Improved limit calculation using multiple exclusive signal regions (previously used cut-and-count results of \MET $>$ 100 GeV signal region).
\item Include reweighting by number of vertices for all MC.
