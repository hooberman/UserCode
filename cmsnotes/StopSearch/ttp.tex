\section{Tail-to-Peak ratio for lepton $+$ jets top and W events}
\label{sec:ttp}

An important component
of the background calculation is the ratio of the number of events with $M_T$ in the signal region
to the number of events with $50 < M_T < 80$~GeV.  
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:ljbg-general}, these ratios are different for \wjets\ and 
top events.

The MC values of these ratios are shown in Table~\ref{tab:ttp}. The e and $\mu$ channel results are averaged before corrections are made.

The MC value of $R_{wjet}$ is corrected based on the studies of CR1 (Section~\ref{sec:cr1}), which
lead to the data/MC scale factor $SFR_{wjet}$ (Table~\ref{tab:cr1yields}).

%$SFR_{top}$  (Table~\ref{tab:cr2yields})

There is no similar scale factor to correct the MC value of $R_{top}$ due to the lack of events in CR2 (Section~\ref{sec:cr2}).
We must therefore use a different procedure to derive a corrected value of $R_{top}$.

We start by defining optimistic (too small) and pessimistic (too large) predictions. 

For the pessimistic prediction, we use the \wjets\ $M_T$ tail-to-peak ratio and data/MC scale factor, $R_{wjet}$ and $SFR_{wjet}$.
This prediction is too large because in \wjets\ events the $M_T$ tail comes from
off-shell Ws and resolution effects, while in top events to first order
only resolution effects matter.

For the optimistic prediction, we use the \ttsl\ $M_T$ tail-to-peak ratio $R_{top}$, but take the \wjets\ data/MC scale factor $SFR_{wjet}$.
This prediction is too small because
the true top scale factor is to first order the same as for on-shell Ws, 
while $SFR_{wjet}$ is a weighted average of the
scale factor for on-shell Ws (which is $>1$) and the
scale factor for off-shell Ws (which is close to 1 as it is well modeled by MC). 

The final prediction is given by the average of the optimistic and pessimistic predictions, and
the systematic uncertainty is given by half the difference between the two.

The corrected values of $R_{wjet}$ and $R_{top}$ are given in Table~\ref{tab:ttpcorr}.
