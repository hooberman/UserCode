\section{Tail-to-Peak ratio for lepton $+$ jets top and W events}
\label{sec:ttp}

An important component
of the background calculation is the ratio of the number of events with $M_T$ in the signal region
to the number of events with $50 < M_T < 80$~GeV.  
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:ljbg-general}, these ratios are different for \wjets\ and 
top events.

The MC values of these ratios are shown in Table~\ref{tab:ttp}. The e and $\mu$ channel results are averaged before corrections are made.

The MC value of $R^{MC}_{wjet}$ is corrected based on the studies of CR1 (Section~\ref{sec:cr1}), which
lead to the data/MC scale factor $SFR_{wjet}$ (Table~\ref{tab:cr1yields}). The corrected $R_{wjet}$ is thus given by $R^{MC}_{wjet} \times SFR_{wjet}$.

%$SFR_{top}$  (Table~\ref{tab:cr2yields})

There is no similar scale factor to correct the MC value of $R^{MC}_{top}$ due to the lack of events in CR2 (Section~\ref{sec:cr2}).
We must therefore use a different procedure to derive a corrected value of $R_{top}$.

We start by defining optimistic (too small) and pessimistic (too large) predictions for $R_{top}$. 

For the pessimistic prediction, we use the \wjets\ MC tail-to-peak ratio and data/MC scale factor, $R^{MC}_{wjet}$ and $SFR_{wjet}$ (i.e. the pessimistic prediction is the same as $R_{wjet}$).
This prediction is too large because in \wjets\ events the $M_T$ tail comes from
off-shell Ws and resolution effects, while in top events to first order
only resolution effects matter.

For the optimistic prediction, we use the \ttsl\ MC tail-to-peak ratio $R^{MC}_{top}$, but take the \wjets\ data/MC scale factor $SFR_{wjet}$.
This prediction is too small because
the true top scale factor is to first order the same as for on-shell Ws, 
while $SFR_{wjet}$ is a weighted average of the
scale factor for on-shell Ws (which is $>1$) and the
scale factor for off-shell Ws (which is close to 1 as it is well modeled by MC). 

The final prediction for $R_{top}$ is given by the average of the optimistic and pessimistic predictions, and
the systematic uncertainty is given by half the difference between the two.

The corrected values of $R_{wjet}$ and $R_{top}$ and their uncertainties are given in Table~\ref{tab:ttpcorr}.
