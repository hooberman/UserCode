\subsection{W+Jets MC Modelling Validation from CR1}
\label{sec:cr1}


The estimate of the uncertainty on this background is based on CR1, 
defined by applying the full signal selection, including the isolated track veto, but requiring 0 b-tags
(CSV medium working point as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:selection}). 
The sample is dominanted by \wjets\ and is thus used to validate the MC modelling of this background. 

In Table~\ref{tab:cr1mtsf} we show the amount that we need to scale the Wjets MC
by in order to have agreement between data and Monte Carlo in the $M_T$ peak 
region, defined as $60 < M_T < 100$ GeV.  These scale factors are not terribly 
important, but it is reassuring that they are not too different from 1.  (ARE THESE
SCALED FOR TRIGGER EFFICIENCY???)

In Table~\ref{tab:cr1yields} we compare the data and MC yields in the four $M_T$ signal regions
and in a looser control region.  We also derive the data/MC scale factors 
$SFR^{e}_{wjet}$ and  $SFR^{\mu}_{wjet}$.  The underlying \met\ and $M_T$ distributions
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cr1met}  and~\ref{fig:cr1mtrest}
