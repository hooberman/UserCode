Additional background contributions from rare processes include
\begin{itemize}
\item  \ttbar\ in association with a boson \ttbar\ + \W\/\dy\ \\
\item \dy+Jets \\
\item diboson \vv\ \\
\item triboson \vvv\ \\
\item dilepton single top \tw. \\
\end{itemize}
These backgrounds are small, contributing at the $\sim 5\%$ level and their predictions are taken 
from MC, normalized to the corresponding cross sections. A $50\%$ systematic uncertainty is 
assigned for all these backgrounds.
Note that these backgrounds are not double-counted because the contribution to the \mt\ peak region
is subtracted off when deriving the \mt\ peak data/MC scale factors. %HOOBERMAN: correct?


Backgrounds from QCD are expected to be small in the signal regions with large \mt\ and \met.
