Step 1) Set up LandS using:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SWGuideLandS


Step 2) Process limits with an example data card (which is provided in this directory).

The card is called 'card.txt.' Open it and have a look.

Limits are calculated in a 2-step process. First, you run the lands.exe program to produce a root file from the data card.

You can do this with:
../test/lands.exe -d card.txt -M Hybrid --freq --ExpectationHints Asymptotic --scanRs 1 --freq --nToysForCLsb 10000 --nToysForCLb 5000 --seed 1234 -n card

This tells lands to run on the specified data card, using a bunch of options which state with type of limit-setting procedure to use, what nuissance models, etc.

Alternative you can just do:
source do.sh

This will produce an output root file called card_m2lnQ.root.  


The second step is to extract the limits by doing:

root -b
.L ../test/fitRvsCLs.C+
run("card_m2lnQ.root","plot")

This is the output:

EXPECTED LIMIT BANDS from(obs, -2s,-1s,median,1s,2s) mass= -1: 6.48307+/-0.0416654, 3.40693+/-0.0820709, 4.41193+/-0.056423, 5.99546+/-0.0385255, 8.38478+/-0.0378183, 11.7169+/-0.0584737
Observed data limit: 6.48307 +/- 0.0416654
expected median limit: 5.99546 +/- 0.0385255

This tells you that the observed limit is 6.5 events, expected limit is 6.0 events, etc. 


Step 3) Follow this if you want to produce a bunch of data cards to run different limits. This only covers single bin counting experiments.

You can make additional cards with makeCards.C.

Open the file and add lines like this.
makeThisCard(dofile,"MET100_MT200" , 5 , 4.7 , 1.27);

The arguements are:
output script to run limits (i.e. doLimits.sh)
name of card to produce
data yield 
background expectation
uncertainty on background expectation in form '1+relative_uncertainty'.

Make the cards by doing:
root -b makeCards.C+

This outputs the cards and a script. To run the limits do:
source doLimits.sh

Then you get a bunch of output root files, and you extract the limits with the procedure above.
