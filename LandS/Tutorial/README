Set up LandS using:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SWGuideLandS

Process Limits by doing:
source do.sh

This will produce an output root file (card_m2lnQ.root).  You extract the limits by doing:

root -b
.L ../test/fitRvsCLs.C+
run("card_m2lnQ.root","plot")


This is the output:

EXPECTED LIMIT BANDS from(obs, -2s,-1s,median,1s,2s) mass= -1: 6.48307+/-0.0416654, 3.40693+/-0.0820709, 4.41193+/-0.056423, 5.99546+/-0.0385255, 8.38478+/-0.0378183, 11.7169+/-0.0584737
Observed data limit: 6.48307 +/- 0.0416654
expected median limit: 5.99546 +/- 0.0385255






You can make additional cards with makeCards.C.

Open the file and add line like this.
makeThisCard(dofile,"MET100_MT200" , 5 , 4.7 , 1.27);

The arguements are:
output script to run limits (i.e. do.sh)
name of card
data yield
background expectation
uncertainty on background expectation in form 1+relative_uncertainty

Make cards by doing:
root -b makeCards.C+

This outputs the cards and a script. To run the limits do:
source doLimits.sh

Then you get a bunch of output root files, you get the limits with the procedure above.
