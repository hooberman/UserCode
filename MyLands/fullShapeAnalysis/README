The following recipe will perform a shape analysis using the results from SUS-11-017 and assuming LM4 signal.
This assumes that you have set up Lands, information can be found here:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/SWGuideLandS



Step 1) Produce root file containing signal and background yields and uncertainties, saved as histograms.

You do this with a file called makeRootFile_LM4.C, this is where the yields in each MET bin for the data, 
signal and backgrounds, and the stat and syst uncertainties, are stored. Currently what I've done is
to separate the results into 4 EXCLUSIVE bins, 30-60, 60-100, 100-200 and >200 using SUS-11-017. 

USAGE:
root -b makeRootFile_LM4.C+;

OUTPUT:
The output is a file called Z_shape_LM4.root



Step 2) Read in the information from the root file and perform the upper limit calculation. This is performed
using the "data card" called Z_shape_LM4.txt. The data card contains the information (number of backgrounds,
which systematic uncertainties to attribute to each background, etc.) that lands needs to interpret the histos
you made in step 1.

USAGE:
../test/lands.exe -d Z_shape_LM4.txt -tB 1000 -tPB 30 -t 1000 -M Bayesian --doExpectation 0

This runs lands using the data card. Currently running in Bayesian mode since its faster, we will switch to CLs later.

OUTPUT:
The output is a bunch of information printed to the screen (yes, this is annoying). In this case you will see:

------------------------------------------------------------
Observed Upper Limit on the ratio R at 95% CL = 0.525759
------------------------------------------------------------

The result is a quantity called R, which is:
R = ( signal yield upper limit ) / ( total expected signal yield )

The reason that R is useful is that if R < 1, then the point is excluded, otherwise its not. In this case we see
that R ~ 0.5, in other words you would exclude a point with ~half the expected cross section of LM4. To interpret
this in terms of a yield upper limit, note that the total expected signal yield is the SUM of the expected backgrounds
in the 4 bins, in other words its the LM4 yield for MET > 30 GeV. The signal yield upper limit is therefore:
signal yield upper limit = R * total expected signal yield = 0.53 * 25.4 = 13.5. 
Therefore the signal yield upper limit for the MET > 30 GeV signal region is 13.5.

When you are doing the SMS scans, note that you will need to put a cross section upper limit at each point:
UL(xsec) = UL(yield) / (efficiency X luminosity)

The efficiency calculation would be the same as the one you did previously, just remember that this is now the
efficiency for MET > 30 GeV.


CLS USAGE:
To get the CLS limit (instead of Bayesian, as above) is a 3-step process:

1) Run lands using the data card: 
../test/lands.exe -d Z_shape_LM4.txt -M Hybrid --freq --ExpectationHints Asymptotic --scanRs 1 --freq --nToysForCLsb 3000 --nToysForCLb 1500 --seed 1234 -n Z_shape_LM4
This time however, the output will be another root file: Z_shape_LM4_m2lnQ.root

2) wait ~2 minutes

3) Now, read in the root file produced in 1) above and get R

root -b ../test/fitRvsCLs.C+
run("Z_shape_LM4_m2lnQ.root","plot")

OUTPUT:
Limit: r < 0.48131 +/- 0.0048994 @ 95% CL

The R value is 0.48, which is ~10% better than the Bayesian limit (this is what we generally see comparing Bayesian vs. CLs)
